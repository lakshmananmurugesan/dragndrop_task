# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
items = Drag.create([{ name: 'item 1'},{ name: 'item 2'},{ name: 'item 3'},{ name: 'item 4'},{ name: 'item 5'},{ name: 'item 6'}])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
